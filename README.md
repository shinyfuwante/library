# library

This is a project to practice the way Javascript deals with Objects. This uses a Book object
and puts it into a library. The user can then access the book by removing it and editing the "read"
attribute. In addition, the user can put a new book into the library by filling out the required
information, by using a form.


Potential improvements: 
<ol>
    <li>Checking for duplicate books (if this were to be a personalized library, I assumed this is a basic library with many copies)</li>
    <li>However, the code should allow read-status to propagate between copies, which this currently does not. </li>
    <li>Back-end and account? </li>
    <li> If desired, change toggle read function to use prototypes </li>
</ol>
